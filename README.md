# MNIST_handwriting_recognition_using_Keras
In this I have written a code to recongnisze the handwritten images used by MNIST. The dataset contains 60,000 images for trainig and 10,000 images for testing.
I have used Keras for implemeting the code.

This is a great program for starters in DeepLearning (Deep Learning with Python, a text book by Francois Chollet calls this program a 'Hello Wrold of Deep Learning' )

I have used the code from the aforementioned book with some changes in number of layers to get better accuracy for the dataset (do not get confused its not a perfect code, we have to still do an overfitting treatment on this, wiich I will uploading as and when i get some time)

Requirments: Python, Keras, Tensorflow
